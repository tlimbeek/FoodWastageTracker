# Food Wastage Tracker Project

## How I worked on this project
- I worked on this project over the course of 2 weeks.
- First, I worked on the header files including member variables and function declarations for the following classes:
  1. food wastage record
  2. food wastage report
  3. food wastage tracker
  4. food wastage tracker backend
- Next, I implemented the function definitions for the above classes in the order listed.
- After implementing member functions in each class, I ran test cases to ensure they worked as planned.
## How to navigate this project
- .h files will show what each class does (member functions) and what information it holds (member variables).
- .cc files will show the logic of how each function manipulates variable data.
## Why I built the project this way
- I completed simpler features first because they were easier to implement and helped keep me motivated.
- Building off of those smaller features, I was able to work towards my larger goal of synthesizing user data into food wastage reports.
## If I had more time I would change this
- I would personalize the UI design to make it more user-friendly and approachable.
- I would store records using a different data structure to reduce searching time complexity.
